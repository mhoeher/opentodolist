            <li>
                #271: When running on mobile devices or when the app window
                is rather small, dynamicall show tool bar icons and do not
                cut them off. Additionally, show a menu which contains all
                actions which are not currently shown as toolbar icons.

            <li>
                #272: The app is now properly packaged and available via

            </li>
            <li>
                #262: Store the created at and updated at timestamps. These
                properties can be used when sorting items e.g. in the library
                page or inside a todo list.
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
                #274: Improved the todo drawer. There were several usability
                issues with the previous implementation, such that it did not
                resize properly and it was not possible to use swipe gestures
                in it.
            </li>
            <li>
                #247: Added a button to set the due date in the swipe menu

                images. This is especially important on iOS when adding
                images from the gallery.

            #224: When running the app packages via Flatpak, passwords
            are now written to the secrets store (like Gnome keyring or
            the KDE Wallet). Before, they have been written to a less
            secure fallback location.

            #230: A bug has been fixed, which caused the app to crash when
            using the search. This bug did not occur all the time.

            #238: Background images have been removed from most views. They
            did not contribute to the usability of the app and even
            worse made the app unnecessarily hard to use for users

      <p>
        This release is rather a maintenance release. It upgrades to at least
        Qt 5.11 on all supported platforms, some even to Qt 5.12. The most interesting
        part is probably that the app is now available via Flatpak. Here is the list of
        all issues that went into the release:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>#209: Update to Qt 5.11.2</li>

            This relase fixes the issues #208, #202, #90, #210, #207,
            #193 and #191. The most notable change among these is the
            introduction of an item cache, which speeds up several
            aspects of the app (start-up, listing of large item
            collections and so on).
