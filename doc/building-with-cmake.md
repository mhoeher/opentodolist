# Building OpenTodoList using `cmake`

The following components are required to build OpenTodoList:

* Qt >= 5.10.0
* CMake >= 2.8.11 (optional)

Building using `cmake` is mostly the same on the various supported platforms. Open a terminal and run the following commands:


```bash
# First, clone the project:
git clone https://gitlab.com/rpdev/opentodolist.git

# Change into the project directory and create a shadow
# build directory:
cd opentodolist
mkdir build
cd build

# Configure the build:
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE ..

# Build the app:
make
```

Depending on your operating system and environment, you might have to
pass additional settings to `cmake`. For example, if you installed
Qt 5 into `/opt/qt510`, then you have to call it like this:


```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE \
    -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/qt510 ..
```

Please refer to the [Qt CMake manual](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/cmake-manual.html)
for more information on using Qt with `cmake`.

Among others, you can set the following CMake parameters (via the `-D` switch)
to control the build and tweak the configuration of the app:

| **Parameter** | **Possible Values** | **Description** |
| ------------- | ------------------- | --------------- |
| `QTKEYCHAIN_STATIC` | ON, OFF | Control if the built in QtKeychain library is build statically or as shared library. |
| `OPENTODOLIST_WITH_UPDATE_SERVICE` | ON, OFF | Enable or disable the update check. |
| `OPENTODOLIST_WITH_APPIMAGE_EXTRAS` | ON, OFF | Enable extra functionality when building the app as AppImage. |
| `OPENTODOLIST_NEXTCLOUD_TEST_URL` | URL including username and password | The URL of a NextCloud instance. If given, unit tests will be run against this NextCloud instance. |
| `OPENTODOLIST_OWNCLOUD_TEST_URL` | URL including username and password | The URL of an ownCloud instance. If given, unit tests will be run against this ownCloud instance. |
