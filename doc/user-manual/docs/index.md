# Welcome

This is the user manual for OpenTodoList - a free and Open Source todo and
note keeping app that runs on a variety of platforms and hence, allows to
keep your precise information synchronized across all of your devices.

!!! note

    This documentation is heavily *work in progress*. OpenTodoList is
    already quite old (in terms of software) and provides a relatively
    big set of features. We will keep extending this documentation over
    time, documenting new features *on the fly* and one by one also add
    documentation for existing ones.
