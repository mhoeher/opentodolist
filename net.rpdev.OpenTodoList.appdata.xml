                #256: The user experience using the Snap version of the app
                has been improved. Concrete, the snap contains all of the

                issues with the previous implementation, such that it did not
                resize properly and it was not possible to use swipe gestures
                in it.

                #247: Added a button to set the due date in the swipe menu

            are now written to the secrets store (like Gnome keyring or

            introduction of an item cache, which speeds up several
            aspects of the app (start-up, listing of large item
            collections and so on).
